We proudly announce:

## ðŸŽ‰ Major release of version 1.0.0 ðŸŽ‰

_There are no changes to the latest `beta` version._

Thanks for all your help, bug reports and feature requests that made this possible.
Our work still continues, we are actively working on new and more features and bug-fixes.

Meet us at the [SITCON.perform](https://sitcon.schwarz/) in our UXDS Design room.

With the **1.0.0** release the package API is stable and there won't be any breaking changes until the next major release.
We don't expect more then one major release per year.
