feat: implemented new `OnyxUnstableSplitButton` component

For now, the component is marked as experimental/unstable which means that it is still under active development and the API might change in patch or minor releases. Keep an eye on the **[**changelog**]**(**https://onyx.schwarz/development/packages/changelogs/sit-onyx.html**) when using it.
