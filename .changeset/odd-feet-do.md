feat(OnyxEmpty): add buttons slot and update colors

You can now pass custom action buttons via the `<template #buttons>` slot.
Also the default icon and text color has changed to neutral (soft) instead of primary.

The default empty icon for the table has also been changed to be aligned with the default of the OnyxEmpty component.
