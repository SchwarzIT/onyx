feat: support global search inside nav bar by default

The default nav bar now features a global search that can be used to search any markdown content as well as changing the app language and color scheme.
The previous search inside the sidebar layout has been removed since it is now redundant. If you still want to include a sidebar search, pass custom content / slots to the sidebar layout.
