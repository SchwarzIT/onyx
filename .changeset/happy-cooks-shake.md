fix: adjust component colors and align with Figma

All components were updated to be aligned with the Figma UX design. This change brings several color/contrast improvements/fixes:

- Button: Update background, text and border colors
- Tag: Update text and border colors
- IconButton: Update text colors
- NavButton (mobile): Update text color
- Pagination: Update text color for buttons
- Stepper: Update text color for +/- button
- update several components to use correct CSS variables for focus and border colors so the correct color is used for specific themes (e.g. `schwarz` theme)
