Nuxt 4 is supported now which means you need to update your project to Nuxt 4 as well when using the `@sit-onyx/nuxt` or `@sit-onyx/nuxt-docs` package

The Nuxt I18n integration of `@sit-onyx/nuxt` now also no longer supports the `iso` property when defining locales which means to need to use `@nuxtjs/i18n >= 9.0.0`, see [Nuxt I18n docs](https://v9.i18n.nuxtjs.org/docs/guide/migrating/)
