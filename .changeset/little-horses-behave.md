feat: implement `_unstableCreateSlider` composable

Special thanks to [lovelycentury](https://github.com/lovelycentury) for contributing the slider to onyx ðŸŽ‰

For now, the slider is marked as experimental/unstable which means that it is still under active development and the API might change in patch or minor releases. Keep an eye on the [changelog](https://onyx.schwarz/development/packages/changelogs/sit-onyx.html) when using the slider.
