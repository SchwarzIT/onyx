feat(OnyxBadge): added interactive Badge
feat(OnyxFilterBadge): implemented new OnyxFilterBadge Component

For now, the OnyxFilterBadge is marked as experimental/unstable which means that it's still under active development and the API might change in patch or minor releases. Keep an eye on the [changelog](https://onyx.schwarz/development/packages/changelogs/sit-onyx.html) when using them.
