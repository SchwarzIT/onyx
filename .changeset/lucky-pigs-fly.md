feat: add `OnyxNavBar` component

If you used one of the `onyx-grid-max-md`, `onyx-grid-max-lg` or `onyx-grid-center` CSS classes which are not placed on the application root, move them to the application root element. See [grid docs](https://onyx.schwarz/development/grid.html#example) for further information
