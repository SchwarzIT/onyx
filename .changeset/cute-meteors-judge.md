feat: implement new `OnyxUnstableTableOfContents` component

For now, the `OnyxUnstableTableOfContents` and `OnyxUnstableTableOfContentsItem` components are marked as experimental/unstable which means that they are still under active development and the API might change in patch or minor releases. Keep an eye on the [changelog](https://onyx.schwarz/development/packages/changelogs/sit-onyx.html) when using them.
