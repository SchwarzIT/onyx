feat: implement new `OnyxUnstableKey` and `OnyxUnstableShortcut` components with `_unstableUseShortcutSequence` composable

For now, components are marked as experimental/unstable which means that they are still under active development and the API might change in patch or minor releases. Keep an eye on the **[**changelog**]**(**https://onyx.schwarz/development/packages/changelogs/sit-onyx.html**) when using components.
