bump minimum Storybook version to `8.3.0-alpha.5`

Storybook version `8.3.0-alpha.5` now official supports the improved source code generation, see [changelog](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/blob/next/CHANGELOG.prerelease.md#830-alpha3) so we removed our temporarily forked source code generator from `@sit-onyx/storybook-utils`.

Therefore, the minimum Storybook version was bumped to `8.3.0-alpha.5` which also includes a bug fix that significantly reduces the bundle size when building the Storybook.
