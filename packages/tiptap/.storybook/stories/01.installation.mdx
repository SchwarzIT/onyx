# Installation

<br />

## Step 1: Install dependencies

Install the npm package with your corresponding package manager:

```sh [pnpm]
pnpm add @sit-onyx/tiptap
```

## Step 2: Imports

After that, import the CSS file, either globally or in a single component:

```ts [main.ts]
import "@sit-onyx/tiptap/style.css";
```

The editor is now ready to be used. For examples, refer to the [OnyxTextEditor](/docs/form-elements-texteditor--docs).
