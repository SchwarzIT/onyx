# Extensions

The editor will automatically adapt depending on your configuration.
E.g. if you disable specific extensions or options (e.g. heading levels), the displayed editor toolbar will adapt accordingly.
Please refer to the instructions below for further customizations.

## Configure starter kit

By default, the `OnyxTextEditor` uses the `OnyxStarterKit` as extensions which is based on the [Tiptap starter kit](https://tiptap.dev/docs/editor/extensions/functionality/starterkit) but includes additional commonly used extensions and is configured with onyx-specific options.

To override / customize the extensions used by the editor, use the `extensions` property which will fully replace the default config.
You can either re-use and configure the default `OnyxStarterKit` here or use your own starter kits / extensions.

Take a look at the [OnyxTextEditor](/story/form-elements-texteditor--customized-starter-kit) for an example implementation.

## Custom extensions

The text editor can be extended with custom extensions / actions. Browse the [Tiptap extensions overview](https://tiptap.dev/docs/editor/extensions/overview) for a full list of extensions.

Take a look at the [OnyxTextEditor](/story/form-elements-texteditor--custom-actions) for an example implementation.
