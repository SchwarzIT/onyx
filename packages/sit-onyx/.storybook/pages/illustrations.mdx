# About illustrations

Illustrations in onyx are ready-to-use SVGs that will also work with both light and dark mode out-of-the-box.
While some illustrations are used internally in other onyx components, you can also use all illustrations as standalone components.

Please not that onyx illustrations are currently work in progress, meaning there will be more illustrations added step by step in the future.
