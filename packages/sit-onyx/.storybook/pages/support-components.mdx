# About support components

Support components in onyx are utility components that are mainly used to build up bigger components (e.g. a single checkbox that is used inside the checkbox group).

Those support components are not mainly intended to be used individually but can be used as building blocks when needed for implementing custom components in your project or customizing existing onyx components.
