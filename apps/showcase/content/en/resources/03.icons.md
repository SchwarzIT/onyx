# Icons

### Attention

Check out the whole icon palette in the [resources](/icons) documentation.
Feel free to browse through all the assets there.

Our system icons are designed to be simple with a touch of detail. They are characteristic, yet easy to understand.

## Grid and keylines

The square format with the 1px grid is the foundation for all of our system icons. This ensures the look of the set in terms of thickness, proportion, shape and weight are the same. The grid helps to design a unified set of icons and still be as flexible as possible.

## Basic layout

The icons are created on a base grid of 32x32px and then reduced or enlarged to the appropriate size. The grid comes with a padding of 2px. The padding should only be exceeded if it is necessary to give additional visual weighting or if a certain element is required to give the icon its characteristic or meaning.

The keylines ensure a certain consistency in shape and proportion in the overall icon set. In exceptional cases and if the design of the icon does not allow otherwise, the design can go beyond the shape.

## Stroke

The weighting of different icons should be the same as possible and should not look heavier or lighter. To make this possible, only a 2px stroke is used.

The distance between parallel strokes is at least 2px. There are a few exceptions which occurs when the icon is complex or has a certain density of line.

## Angles

The basic angle is 45°. If necessary, the increments of 15° and 5° are the next steps.

## Corners

Unified corner radius ensure the element is recognizable and in harmony with the set. 2px is the standard radius and can be increased in further steps of two.

## Sizes

All icons are created as vector graphics and due to the base unit, the icons are limited to specific sizes.

The default size is 24x24px, but we also use a smaller and a larger variant based on the system patterns.

| Name | Size        |
| ---- | ----------- |
| 2xs  | 12px square |
| xs   | 16px square |
| sm   | 24px square |
| md   | 32px square |
| lg   | 48px square |
| xl   | 64px square |
| 2xl  | 96px square |

# Icons

onyx includes a set of well-crafted SVG icons that are free to use.

If you want to download the icons as SVG, please head over to our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/SchwarzIT/onyx/tree/main/packages/icons/src/assets).

A full changelog can be found [here](/development/packages/changelogs/icons).

## Installation

To get started, install the npm package with your corresponding package manager:

:npm-install-code-tabs{packages="@sit-onyx/icons" dev}

Afterwards, you can import and use icons as needed. Please see the [OnyxIcon](https://storybook.onyx.schwarz/?path=/docs/basic-icon--docs) for the technical documentation.

## Usage

There are two different ways of using / importing icons from this package:

### Option 1: JavaScript import (recommended)

For the best developer experience, it is recommended to use JavaScript imports. This approach also supports IDE intellisense, so you can e.g. just start typing "icon" in your editor and all available icons will be suggested to you.

```ts
import { iconPlaceholder } from "@sit-onyx/icons";

// or to import all icons (note: no tree-shaking will be supported then):
// import * as ALL_ICONS from "@sit-onyx/icons";
```

### Option 2: Import from SVG file

Alternatively, you can import the icon from the raw SVG file:

```ts
// Note that "?raw" is needed to import the SVG content instead of a path to the file itself.
// ?raw will be resolved by the bundler (e.g. Vite).
// if you want to import the path to the icon instead of the content, you can omit the "?raw" part
import iconPlaceholder from "@sit-onyx/icons/placeholder.svg?raw";
```

## Available icons

You can hover over an icon to see its name. Click on it or press enter when selecting it via keyboard to copy the import statement for the selected icon.
