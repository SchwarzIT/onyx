# Typography

## UX

The onyx font system includes two different font families that can be used throughout your application, pending on the usecase. It contains several headline styles as well as paragraph styles and mono space styles.

### Info

The font families that can be used with onyx are:

- [Source Sans 3](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Sans+3)
- [Source Code Pro](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Code+Pro?query=source)

Lidl and Kaufland font families are coming soon.

## DEV

The onyx design system relies on a default (sans-serif) and a monospace font family.

onyx is intended to be used with the following font families which are open-source
and free to use under the [SIL Open Font License](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIL_Open_Font_License):

- Default: [Source Sans 3](https://fontsource.org/fonts/source-sans-3)
- Monospace: [Source Code Pro](https://fontsource.org/fonts/source-code-pro)

---

## Brand typography

The default font family is defined to be the Source Sans and Source Code Pro (monospace). If you are creating a new onyx project in Figma, this will always be included out-of-the-box. In the initial phase, Source Sans applies to all color themes that are provided by onyx.

If you want to use font families in development, please take a look at the [technical documentation](/development/typography).

## Headlines

The onyx design system offers four types of headlines. H1 is reserved for the main title of the page because it establishes primary focus and captures the user’s attention. The h2 style is used for describing sections in the interface. Its main goal is to cluster different types of content into groups and labelling them. Single elements, on the other hand, are described by the h3 style. The least impact, and therefore the lowest hierarchy, has the h4. It is used for structuring information inside a single component. Table column headlines is a good example at this point.

For the technical implementation of the headlines, please see the [technical documentation](https://storybook.onyx.schwarz/?path=/docs/basic-headline--docs).

### warning

Note that h5 and h6 headlines are not part of the onyx font system and should not be used therefore.
Because they can occur on technical side for semantic reasons, they are styled the same as h4.

## Paragraphs

Paragraph texts are used for all kinds of information, explanations, narratives and continuous text in general. The default size is used as standard throughout all applications. The small-sized paragraph style is used for labels and is therefore in a lower hierarchical order. The largest paragraph style is used for very strong and eye-catchy information, because it has the biggest visual impact.

For the technical implementation of the paragraphs, please see the [technical documentation](/development/typography#font-styles).

## Links

Links are the tool of choice to refer to another page. By default, links have an underline and are primary-colored. Under consideration of the text styling principles, the text color can be changed in exceptional usecases. Please double check with your assigned UX-Designer.

For the technical implementation of the links, please see the [technical documentation](https://storybook.onyx.schwarz/?path=/docs/navigation-link--docs).

## Usage

It is important to keep the usage of font styles consistent throughout the whole application. Only by following this principle, a clean and hierarchical UI structure can be guaranteed. You should focus on the correct usage for headlines in particular! If you have questions about it, please contact your assigned UX-Designer.

## Line length

To create a flowing readability, the line length is key. There are no strict rules on the usage, due to the dependency on [screen size, breakpoint and column grid](/basics/breakpoints-grid). Nevertheless onyx provides some guidelines and recommendations for your implementation.

![narrow, ideal and wide line length](/images/line_length.webp)

Generally speaking: the wider the line the harder to read and to follow. The optimal range for readability is usually between 60 and 80 characters. If the text is way longer than this guideline, just use a second text column instead.

## Writing style

If you want to use text in your application, please take the following principles into account.

### Focus

Formulate your text purposefully and concisely. Do not use unnecessary verbiage. Nevertheless, form short, complete and grammatically correct sentences.

### Descriptive

Describe prompts clearly and use the imperative (especially with buttons). Buttons are always titled with verbs and should at best consist of only one word. More than one word is possible in exceptional cases.

### Hierarchy

Hierarchy is key to a well working user experience. Always be aware on how to use section titles and element headlines.
Also use [color and contrast](/basics/colors) for creating hierarchy in a subtle way.

### Context

Texts must always have a connection to the things that are going on in the screen, in terms of content.
Never text about content, the user cannot relate to.

### Consistency

Texts should never be built in uppercase. Always use the provided line height for spacing. Do not try to squeeze characters or text blocks. Less is more - Minimalism is key.

## Installation

To install and use the recommended onyx font families, install them by running

:npm-install-code-tabs{packages="@fontsource-variable/source-sans-3 @fontsource-variable/source-code-pro"}

and then import them in your main TypeScript / CSS file, e.g.:

```ts [main.ts]
import "@fontsource-variable/source-code-pro";
import "@fontsource-variable/source-sans-3";
```

or if you are using Nuxt, then import them in your `nuxt.config.ts`:

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  css: ["@fontsource-variable/source-sans-3", "@fontsource-variable/source-code-pro"],
});
```

For further information about the font families or installation, refer to the [Fontsource docs](https://fontsource.org).

## Using custom font families

If you want to use custom font families, you need to install and import them like mentioned [above](#installation).
Afterwards, you need to override the following CSS variables like shown below so the font families are picked up by all onyx components.

We recommend installing font families as npm package using [Fontsource](https://fontsource.org).

```css [custom.css]
:root {
  --onyx-font-family: "My custom font family", sans-serif;
  --onyx-font-family-mono: "My custom mono font family", monospace;
}
```

```ts [main.ts]
// import your custom fonts here...
import "custom.css";
```

## Font styles

onyx provides some utility CSS classes for font styles that can be used to style custom text components like `<p>` or `<span>`.

| Class                                    | Description                                            |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `class="onyx-text"`                      | Sets the default font size and line height             |
| `class="onyx-text onyx-text--small"`     | Same as `onyx-text` but in small size and line height  |
| `class="onyx-text onyx-text--large"`     | Same as `onyx-text` but in large size and line height  |
| `class="onyx-text onyx-text--monospace"` | Same as `onyx-text` but with the monospace font family |

# Truncation

The decision to use line break or truncation depends on various factors, including the type of content, available space and the desired user experience. Due to flexibility, onyx provides both properties to ensure the best solution for each usecase.

## Line break

Use line breaks when maintaining the readability and flow of the text is crucial. Breaking content into multiple lines can make it easier for users to scan and comprehend.

![flyout with line breaks](/images/line_break.webp)

Line breaks are suitable when the nature of the content benefits from a more extended and continuous presentation. They can help leverage whitespace effectively, creating a visually balanced layout. This is particularly useful for interfaces, where a more open and spacious design is preferred.

## Truncation

Truncation is essential when there is limited space, such as cards or narrow columns. It allows to present concise information without sacrificing the overall layout.

![flyout with truncation](/images/truncation.webp)

Truncation is effective in preventing clutter, especially when dealing with long titles, headlines or labels. When using truncation, please ensure that the element is still readable and understandable. If not, please have a look at the [abbreviations section](#abbreviations).

In responsive usecases, truncation can be employed to adopt content to varying screen sizes.

## Abbreviations

Abbreviations can be powerful tools in designing and building an interface for conveying information succinctly. However, their effective use requires careful consideration to ensure clarity and a positive user experience. Here are some key points to focus on:

### Clarity is key

Prioritize clarity over brevity. Users should easily understand abbreviations without confusion. Use widely recognized abbreviations or provide clear explanations.

### Consistent usage

Maintain consistency in how abbreviations are used throughout the whole application. Inconsistent usage disrupts the overall coherence of the interface.

### Avoid overuse

Avoid densely clustering abbreviations in a single space. Overuse can overwhelm users visually. Prioritize for the most important and common abbreviations.

### Tooltips

Whenever possible, implement tooltips on hover to provide users with expanded details about abbreviations. This extra layer of information ensures users are not left guessing.
