EINLEITUNGSATZ, WAS AUF DER SEITE ZU FINDEN IST, FEHLT!

## Color scheme

::info-card{color="info" headline="Usage"}
Always use the Semantic layer for your designs. The Global layer is the "source code" of the colors and should remain untouched to ensure the integrity of the automatic light/dark mode switching.

Ist das wichtig die hier zu sehen oder zu beschreiben, wenn die sich nicht verwenden lassen?

### Semantics

- Band-primary
- Brand-secondary
- Neutral
- Danger
- Warning
- Success
- Info
- Quantitatives

## Usage

### Call-to-action (CTA)

Use the CTA color as a strategic accent to drive user engagement and signal primary interactivity.

- Application: Reserve this color for high-priority focal points, such as primary action buttons and critical interactive elements.
- Constraint: Apply sparingly. Overuse diminishes its psychological impact and disrupts the visual hierarchy.
- Source: Always utilize the curated value derived from the primary brand spectrum to ensure alignment.

### Page background

Apply the Page Background as the mandatory foundation for all application surfaces.

- Application: Use exclusively for the global background of the interface to serve as the system’s base layer.
- Compliance: Do not substitute this value. All system-wide contrast ratios and WCAG accessibility standards are strictly calibrated against this specific neutral token.
- Consistency: Consistent use is required to maintain visual integrity during light/dark mode transitions.

### Component Background

Maintain a transparent (blank) background for individual UI components.

- Logic: Leave the component fill empty to allow the mandatory Page Background to show through.
- Definition: Use outlines rather than solid fills to create surface separation and define component boundaries. This ensures a clean, lightweight aesthetic that scales across themes.

### Brand Colors

Implement brand colors as minimalist identifiers rather than decorative elements.

- Primary Brand Color: Apply as the core identifier present in every theme.
- Secondary Brand Color: Use only for specific, predefined accent occasions to maintain system stability.
- Strategic Intent: Prioritize business logic over marketing aesthetics. This system provides a reduced interpretation of brand essences to ensure functionality within enterprise applications.

### Neutral Colors

Utilize the neutral palette as the structural backbone for all layouts and UI scaffolding.

- Application: Use for typography, icons, borders, and secondary backgrounds to achieve a professional, "clean" aesthetic.
- Selection: Do not create custom neutrals. Each brand theme is pre-assigned one of three core-curated neutral palettes to guarantee optimal accessibility.
- Spectrum: Navigate the scale from near-white to near-black to establish depth and contrast within the interface.

### System Colors

Use system colors to communicate functional status and provide immediate semantic feedback. These colors are reserved for specific states and must not be used for decorative branding.

| State   | Intention                          | Usage                                                                 | Strategy                                         |
| :------ | :--------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------- |
| Danger  | Urgent intervention required.      | Critical alerts, destructive actions (e.g., delete), blocking errors. | Signal high-priority risk and prevent data loss. |
| Warning | Medium-priority caution.           | Security prompts, non-blocking errors, potential consequences.        | Alert user to proceed with caution.              |
| Success | Confirmation of positive outcomes. | Task completion, "Saved" status, healthy system processes.            | Provide reinforcement and task closure.          |
| Info    | Objective, neutral information.    | General updates, tips, straightforward guidance.                      | Provide clarity without creating alarm.          |

### Quantitatives

Use the quantitative palette exclusively for data visualization to ensure clarity and professional data storytelling.

- Application: Use only for infographics, such as bar charts, pie graphs, and data-heavy dashboards, to distinguish between distinct data segments.
- Constraint: Do not use these colors for standard UI elements (buttons, backgrounds, or navigation). They are intentionally decoupled from the brand palette to avoid semantic confusion.
- Goal: To maximize legibility and ensure that complex datasets remain easy to interpret through high-contrast, distinct hues.

### Color ratio

Apply the 60-30-10 guideline to establish a balanced visual hierarchy and ensure a harmonious user experience.

| Ratio   | Role       | Implementation                     | Typical Elements                                                        |
| :------ | :--------- | :--------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **60%** | Foundation | `onyx-color-base-background-blank` | Main page body, workspace backgrounds, large empty areas.               |
| **30%** | Support    | Brand-neutral palette              | Secondary buttons, borders, cards, navigation sidebars, and icons.      |
| **10%** | Accent     | Brand-primary color                | Primary CTAs, active states, progress indicators, and key focus points. |

## UX

Colors play a crucial role in an user interface for enhancing the visual appeal and user experience. They go beyond just aesthetics, serving as powerful tools to convey information, establish hierarchy, and evoke emotions. The usage of a well-thought-out color scheme can guide users, highlight important elements and create a cohesive and memorable design. The choice of colors significantly influences how users perceive and interact with the interface, making it an integral aspect of an effective design.

onyx supports a dark and a light theme as well as custom color themes. The options how to set up the theme for your application are described on this page.

## DEV

## Understanding light & dark mode

The onyx color scheme is tightly connect to the [design variable systematic](/variables/introduction), that applies the values to the interface. Therefore, please get familiar with the logic of [variable levels](/variables/introduction) used in onyx. This will be the foundation of understanding how colors will be interpreted for light and dark mode.

To learn more about how to configure the light & dark mode in your application, refer to the [technical documentation](/development/theming).

### Global color scheme

In order to establish a versatile foundation that offers both, a light and dark mode, onyx colors are based on a comprehensive global color palette designed to work as a universally adaptable scheme. This palette spans from the lightest luminosity to the deepest darkness, covering a broad spectrum. However, it's important to note that the extremes at both ends of the palette are not suitable for all modes. Specifically, the delineation is set by values of 100 and 1200, demarcating the boundaries for usability in different modes. It's also important to know that this nuanced palette of global shades is intentionally excluded from the design and development process of creating an onyx user interface.

### Semantic color scheme

The color values within the global color scheme have been precisely translated into the semantic context of light and dark mode. This refinement involves condensing the scale to a series of 9 values in increments of 100, with the pivotal point of 500 serving as the default reference for both light and dark modes. Notably, the semantic color schemes for the light mode now refers to a distinct spectrum when compared to their dark mode counterparts.

Semantic colors are defined in relation to the background, dynamically adjusting luminance to harmonize with the unique characteristics of each mode. This intentional differentiation ensures that the visual aesthetics of the interface remain optimal in both light and dark settings.

### Example

## Themes

Beyond the different shades, the hues in a color scheme also significantly impact the overall appearance. onyx offers two main types of color palettes: "themed color palettes" and "universal color palettes". Themed colors set the brand's tone in the UI, defining its unique look. Universal colors, on the other hand, support system information and are used across all themes to complete the brand's color range. This thoughtful approach ensures a good balance between expressing the brand's style and maintaining clarity and functionality for users.

To have access to the color variable set for your implementation, please visit the [variable documentation](/variables/colors).

## Roles of themed colors

Themed colors reflect the brand's identity, adapting their main colors. While primary colors vary between the themes, the usage of them is constant.

Primary colors highlight call-to-action elements and direct the focus of the user to the most important interactions. Brand-neutrals are used in the background and secondary actions, providing a subtle backdrop that allows primary colors to shine.

### Page background

The background color of the whole page is always set to `onyx-color-base-background-tinted`, which referrs to the brand-neutral palette, to be a very subtle color.

### Component background

The default background color of components is always `onyx-color-base-background-blank` to be white in light mode und very dark in dark mode.

### Call-to-actions

Call-to-actions are always used with the `onyx-color-base-primary-500` value.

## Roles of universal colors

Universal colors serve a specific role independent from the chosen theme. This is the hierarchical logic behind it:

### Danger

The danger color is used for urgent situations that need immediate attention. It's specifically for critical notifications or interactions linked to deletions and should be used carefully to convey seriousness.

### Warning

The warning color communicates medium-urgent situations and is less important than the danger color. It's suitable for scenarios like security questions where caution is needed.

### Success

The success color shows positive outcomes or successful task completion, giving a sense of achievement. It's used when announcing successful operations or good news.

### Info

The info color is for sharing non-emotional information and is the least important among universal colors. It's used when giving straightforward information without any emotional tone.

### Quantitatives

Quantitative colors help makeing [infographics](/basics/infographics) look good. They're used to distinguish between different parts in graphs, charts, or other visuals, making it easier to understand quantitative information.

## Ratio

The recommendation for working with colors is described with the 60-30-10 guideline, aiming to achieve a harmonious visual composition. This principle suggests allocating 60% of the interface being blank, serving as a cohesive backdrop.

30% of colors should be used as supportive elements, complementing the blank hue, with the usage of brand-neutal colors.

The remaining 10% are dedicated to an accent color, strategically applied to highlight the key elements and call-to-actions. This in fact, is always the brand-primary color in the onyx design system.

## Contrast

To ensure a good contrast, orient yourself on the following principles.

### Balance brightness

Ensure a clear distinction between foreground and background colors by balancing their brightness. A well considered contrast through brightness enhances legibility and visual harmony.

### Text color ratio

Adhere to the onyx [accessibility standards](/basics/accessibility), aiming for sufficient contrast ratios between text and background colors. This ensures readability for users with different visual abilities.

### Hierarchy through intensity

Establish hierarchy by varying color intensity, using the color shade palette.

## Themes

To use a different theme, add the corresponding imports to your `main.ts` file (example a theme called "my-theme"):

code-group

```ts [main.ts]
// import "sit-onyx/styles.css";
// make sure to import the theme AFTER the general "sit-onyx/styles.css" file!
import "./my-theme.css";
```

or if you are using Nuxt, then import them in your `nuxt.config.ts`:

code-group

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  css: ["~/assets/css/my-theme.css"],
});
```

## Dark mode

Per default, onyx will be displayed in light mode. In order to use the dark mode, simply set the class `dark` once on the root of your application, e.g. on `<html>` or `<body>`.

### Let the user decide

In order to let the user switch between light, dark and auto mode, we recommend to use the pre-built [OnyxColorSchemeMenuItem](https://storybook.onyx.schwarz/?path=/docs/navigation-navbar-modules-colorschemedialog--docs) component inside the [nav bar](https://storybook.onyx.schwarz/?path=/story/navigation-navbar--with-context-area) together with the [@vueuse/core](https://vueuse.org/core/useColorMode) library.

Additionally, to enable a smooth transition when switching between color modes, you can use the `useThemeTransition` composable. This ensures a visually appealing effect during theme changes.

Below is an example implementation:

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { useColorMode } from "@vueuse/core";
import { OnyxNavBar, OnyxUserMenu, OnyxColorSchemeMenuItem } from "sit-onyx";
import { ref } from "vue";

const { store: colorScheme } = useColorMode({ disableTransition: false });
useThemeTransition(colorScheme);
</script>

<template>
  <OnyxNavBar app-name="Example app">
    <template #contextArea>
      <OnyxUserMenu full-name="John Doe">
        <OnyxColorSchemeMenuItem v-model="colorScheme" />
      </OnyxUserMenu>
    </template>
  </OnyxNavBar>
</template>
```

Alternatively, you can use the [OnyxColorSchemeDialog](https://storybook.onyx.schwarz/?path=/docs/support-colorschemedialog--docs) component to build your own custom component.
