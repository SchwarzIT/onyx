## System

Density refers to the amount of vertical white space within a component and the height of its primary interactive element. To provide a flexible toolkit for various user preferences and device capabilities, this design system offers three density levels: Compact, Default, and Cozy. These levels use fixed base heights of 32px, 40px, and 48px.

| Density     | Base Height | Application                                                                   | Benefit                                                                        |
| :---------- | :---------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Compact** | **32px**    | Expert interfaces, data-heavy dashboards, and complex data grids.             | Maximizes information density and optimizes limited screen space.              |
| **Default** | **40px**    | Standard baseline for most enterprise and general-purpose applications.       | Balances scannability with visual comfort across all devices.                  |
| **Cozy**    | **48px**    | Content-focused layouts, touch-friendly interfaces, and simplified workflows. | Increases readability and reduces cognitive load through spacious white space. |

## Properties

You can switch the density using the density property of supported components or by applying CSS classes at any level of your application:

- `onyx-density-compact`
- `onyx-density-default`
- `onyx-density-cozy`

For more information, see the specific [component](https://storybook.onyx.schwarz/?path=/docs/introduction--docs) documentation.

## UX

Density refers to the amount of vertical white space a component has, as well as the height of the main (interactive) element of a component.

We offer three levels of density - **compact**, **default** and **cozy** - onyx provides a flexible toolkit to build applications for multiple user preferences and device capabilities. The three densities are always based around the specific values of **32px**, **40px**, and **48px**.

## DEV

Density refers to the amount of vertical white space a component has, as well as the height of the main (interactive) element of a component.
You can find more details about the design perspective in the [density design documentation](../basics/density).

## Compact

This is ideal for users, who prefer a more condensed layout. Compact density maximizes the amount of information displayed on the screen. It's particularly beneficial for offering an efficient use of limited space.

## Default

Striking a balance between information density and visual comfort, default component density is the standard that caters to a broad user base and is recommended to most of the applications. It ensures a comfortable and intuitive experience for users across various devices and screen sizes.

## Cozy

Designed for users who appreciate a more spacious and visually relaxed interface, cozy density introduces plenty of whitespace between and inside elements. This level of density enhances readability and provides visually appealing experience, suitable for users who prioritize on a more leisure interaction.

## Properties

The density can be easily switched via the `density` property of supported components. Please take a look at the [components](https://storybook.onyx.schwarz) for further information.

# Density System

The density can be set for the whole app, part of the app or a single component using the following CSS classes:

- `onyx-density-compact`
- `onyx-density-default`
- `onyx-density-cozy`

For convenience, the respective components also allow setting the density level via a `density` property.
This will set the density class on the component accordingly:

```vue
<OnyxComponent density="compact" />
<!-- is equivalent to -->
<OnyxComponent class="onyx-density-compact" />

<OnyxComponent density="default" />
<!-- is equivalent to -->
<OnyxComponent class="onyx-density-default" />

<OnyxComponent density="cozy" />
<!-- is equivalent to -->
<OnyxComponent class="onyx-density-cozy" />
```
