title: States
description: Component states in UI design refer to the various conditions or interactions a UI element can undergo while being used by the enduser. These states allow designers and developers to depict how components visually and functionally respond to the users actions, providing feedback and enhancing the user experience by being consistent.

# States

EINLEITUNG fehlt!

## Defintion

States define the various visual and functional conditions a component undergoes during interaction. These states communicate the component's status to the user and determine how it responds to input.

Our design system aligns with standard web practices for component states to ensure consistent implementation and intuitive usage.

## Important

Not every component supports all available states. Only states that are supported by a specific component will be implemented.

The onyx design system follows the web standards for component states to provide the easiest usage and implementation.

Below you can find a list of available onyx states. Note: The list does not contain all technical available states but only relevant ones for onyx components.
