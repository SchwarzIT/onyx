# Component states

Component states in UI design refer to the conditions a UI element undergoes during use.
These states determine how components respond visually and functionally to user actions.

**Note:** Some components might not support all states. Only supported states are implemented for a specific component.

The onyx design system uses web standards for component states as much as possible, to simplify usage and implementation.

The following list includes relevant states which affect most component designs.
