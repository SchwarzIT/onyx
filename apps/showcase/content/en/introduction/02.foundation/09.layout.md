# Layout

Effective layouts direct user attention and establish clear information hierarchies. A well-chosen layout serves as a guiding hand, assisting the user in navigating the application intuitively. To create an attractive and accessible interface, we follow three core principles:

## Core Principles

- Responsive: Layouts must be adaptive, ensuring structural integrity and usability across all devices and screen sizes.
- Clean & Precise: Adhering to our mandatory column grid is the only way to build pixel-perfect interfaces that scale reliably.
- Content-Driven: The layout must be dictated by the content, not the other way around. We prioritize the structural needs of information before selecting a layout pattern.

## Page Anatomy

This section defines the global regions of an application. For the anatomy of specific UI elements, please refer to the Component Documentation. In its most comprehensive form, a typical page consists of four regions:

- Main Navigation: Provides access to top-level pages and global interactions. This region is persistent (fixed at the top or left) and independent of the scroll container.
- Side Navigation: Facilitates navigation within a master-detail structure or provides secondary interactions. It remains fixed to the side of the screen.
- Page Content: The primary area for displaying information. This section is flexible, governed by the column grid, and serves as the main scroll container of the interface.
- Confirmation Bar: A global region at the bottom of the screen for triggering confirmations or status updates. It is independent of scrolling and can be applied to specific objects or the entire page.

## Alignment & Placement

### Page Alignment

By default, our design system utilizes left-aligned column grids. While a center-aligned version is possible, we recommend choosing based on the specific use case, target user group, and screen density. When in doubt, stick to the default left-alignment.

### Component Alignment

Internal component structures are always left-aligned. The only exception to this rule is within table columns, which may utilize center or right alignment for specific data types.

## Content Structure

### Vertical Flow (Standard)

A vertical, scrollable layout is the default approach for most applications. It provides the most intuitive and easiest way for users to consume content progressively.

### Horizontal Structure (Comparative)

Placing content sections side-by-side is advantageous for master-detail views or interactivity requiring direct comparison. However, this approach is limited by available horizontal screen real estate. Assess your use case carefully before opting for a horizontal layout.

### Visual Rhythm & Grouping

To establish a sense of structure, we focus on the visual and functional connection between elements:

- Proportion & Balance: Maintaining balanced proportions across content sections ensures a smooth, professional appearance.
- Spatial Grouping: Objects sharing similar functionality or content should be visually clustered. We use open space (white space), typography, and dividers to distinguish these groups and reduce cognitive load.

Different layouts are the best way to focus the users attention and create hierarchy. Additionally, a well chosen layout serves as a guiding hand for the user to work with the application. Our recommended way to create both an attractive and accessible layout is to follow the principles below.

## Responsive

Layouts should be adaptive in their structure displayed on [multiple devices and screensizes](/basics/breakpoints-grid).

## Clean

Using a [column grid](/basics/breakpoints-grid) for creating interfaces with onyx is not only mandatory but also the best way to build pixel perfect and adaptive layouts.

## Content related

Whether implementing a sidebar for horizontal content structure or building a vertical only scrollable page, the layout always has to match the content - not the other way around. First think about how to structure the content and put it in a fitting layout afterwards.

## Anatomy

This section defines the anatomy of the whole page layout. If you want to learn more about the anatomy of single components in particular, please visit the [component documentation](https://storybook.onyx.schwarz/?path=/docs/layout-about-layouts--docs).

In a maximum expression, a typical page layout consists of these regions.

## 1. Main Navigation

Primary navigation to jump between major pages inside the application. In addition, global interactions can be placed here. This section always sticks to the top (alternatively to the left side) and is independent from scrolling.

## 2. Side Navigation

Secondary navigation to jump between pages that are part of the master-detail-structure. In order to be a flexible object, secondary interactions and information can also be placed here. This section always sticks to the side of the screen and is independent from scrolling.

## 3. Page content

The main content is displayed here. This is totally flexible in its representation and depends on the used grid and components. This section is the main scroll container of the interface.

## 4. Confirmation

Global confirmations are triggered by a global section at the bottom of the screen. It is independent from scrolling and sticks to the bottom. This section can also be applied to objects.

This is just an example layout for showing the possibilities of having several sections. It is important to be aligned with the [column grid](/basics/breakpoints-grid), that is provided by onyx. For more information about the components for main navigation, side navigation and confirmation, please visit the [component documentation](https://storybook.onyx.schwarz/?path=/docs/layout-about-layouts--docs).

## Alignment

### Page layout

Column grids for the whole page layout are always **left aligned** by default.

![left aligned content](/images/layout_alignment_left.webp)

A **center aligned** version is possible alternatively. The choice of alignment doesn't follow strict rules. But please consider the balance of the target screen size, the target user group, the target use-case and the content you are building/designing for.

![center aligned content](/images/layout_alignment_center.webp)

### Component layout

The local structure of components is always **left aligned**. The only exception here are the center aligned and right aligned options for table columns.

## Structure of content

### Vertical structure

For structuring the content of the page, a vertical layout, that can scroll down, is the easiest way by default.

### Horizontal structure

Another alternative is the horizontal layout. By having two sections of content next to each other horizontally, the user gets a better side by side comparison/interactivity between the content groups. This could be a big advantage for some usecases. Nevertheless, you are limited by available space due to screen size restrictions, what marks the big disadvantage on the other side. So please assess your content and your use case carefully to find the right layout for your application.

## Visual rhythm

In every designated section of the layout, it is crucial to organize components and internal elements under a manner that maintains visual and functional connections among elements, regardless of the size of the screen.

To guarantee an smooth overall appearance, it is key to keep the proportions of content section in balance.

To establish a sense of structure in a layout, the initial phase involves visually grouping objects. Elements within a layout that share similar content or functionality can be clustered together and distinguished from other elements through the use of open space, typography and dividers for example.
