# Images

Images are essential visual elements that convey information, enhance aesthetics, and improve the user experience.

## Design purpose

- Efficiency: They communicate complex concepts and emotions faster than text.
- Clarity: They complement textual content, making information digestible and memorable.
- Engagement: High-quality imagery creates a professional aesthetic and builds a connection with the user.

## Image selection

### Color gamut

Select images where a single primary hue (e.g., blue, green, or red) dominates the composition.

- Do: Choose images with a harmonious, monochromatic, or analogous color profile.
- Don’t: Use images with a high-saturation mix of multiple competing primary colors.
- Tip: Use varying color gamuts across different pages to provide users with subtle visual cues for navigation and orientation.

### Natural lighting

Prioritize soft, authentic light sources to maintain a grounded and realistic aesthetic.

- Do: Ensure the light is naturally balanced and the subjects appear evenly lit.
- Don’t: Use images with harsh highlights, deep shadows, or high-contrast studio lighting, especially on faces.
- Tip: Avoid over-processing or applying highly stylized filters that make the image look artificial.

### Authentic snapshots

Choose "candid" imagery that feels like a captured moment in time rather than a staged production.

- Do: Look for natural movements and genuine human interactions.
- Don’t: Use images with forced expressions, "stock-photo" smiles, or clearly rehearsed poses.
- Tip: Every photo should feel like a real-life snapshot of a normal, unscripted action.

### Visual simplicity

Focus on minimalist compositions that emphasize a single, clear message.

- Do: Look for images with generous "negative space" or clean backgrounds.
- Don’t: Select cluttered scenes or images with too many competing focal points.
- Tip: Simple images reduce visual noise and make the visual statement immediate and clear.

### Direct authenticity

Use "pure" photography that has not been digitally manipulated or constructed.

- Don’t: Use images featuring post-production overlays like text, icons, or 3D graphics.
- Don’t: Use purely 3D-generated environments or artificial characters.
- Rule: Every asset must feel captured by a camera, never constructed on a computer.

### Technical quality

Verify that every asset meets high-fidelity technical standards before implementation.

- Do: Use high-resolution files that remain sharp on all screen types.
- Don’t: Accept assets with visible pixelation, compression artifacts, or motion blur.
- Rule: If individual pixels are visible, the image is not fit for use.

Images in a user interface serve as visual elements designed to convey information, enhance aesthetics, and improve overall user experience. These visual impacts play several key roles in UI design:

## Visual communication

Images are powerful tools for conveying messages and information quickly. They can communicate concepts, emotions, and information more effectively than text alone.

## Information enhancement

Images can complement textual information, making it more digestible and memorable. [Infographics, charts, and diagrams](/basics/infographics) are examples of how images can enhance the presentation of complex data or concepts.

## Emotional connection

Images have the power to evoke emotions and connect with users on a more personal level. Well-chosen images can create a positive and memorable user experience. They also contribute to the overall aesthetic appeal of a UI, enhancing its visual appeal and making it more engaging.

### Warning: Accessibility

Images need to be optimized for accessibility by including descriptive alt text. This ensures that users with visual impairments or those using [screen readers](/basics/accessibility#screen-readers) can still understand the content conveyed by the images.

## Sources

In general you are free to use any image source. But pay attention on the licensing for those images. The onyx design system is not responsible for any kind of license violation or other legal fallacies and dissociates itself from any kind of license violation.

To prevent any kind of legal issues, onyx recommends to use either your own copyright images or royalty free sources like:

## Image selection

### Reduce color gamut

The image should employ a reduced color gamut. This means for instance that it is mainly blue, green, or red but not at the same time equally blue, green, and red. Different color gamuts can be used in an application for different pages to distinguish them from each other.

### Natural light

The pictures should look like they were taken in natural light. Avoid hard light or shadows, in particular on the faces of people. The images should be naturally balanced and not look stylized. Avoid strong contrasts in images.

### Snap shots

The pictures should look natural and not posed. This means that the pictures should not depict forced or posed expressions of actions. The picture should be a snap shot of a normal and natural movement.

### Visual simplicity

The images should not contain too many prominent elements. Generous use of free space makes the statement of the picture clearer and simpler.

### No artificially placed elements

Avoid images on which text, graphics, or 3D elements were placed afterwards. Also avoid images that were created completely in 3D.

### High image quality

Make sure to use images of high quality. You should never be able to see individual pixels.
