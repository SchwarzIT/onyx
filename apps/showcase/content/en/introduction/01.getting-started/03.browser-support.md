# Browser Support

Our design system is built for the modern web and supports current browser versions.

## Overview

- We perform extensive end-to-end (E2E) testing against the following browsers to ensure the best possible support.
- While older versions might function, we do not guarantee full compatibility.

::info-card{color="info" headline="Older browser versions"}
If you need to support specific older browser versions, use `lightningcss` with `@vitejs/plugin-legacy` or `nuxt-vite-legacy` for Nuxt applications. These tools provide polyfills and syntax lowering to ensure compatibility.
::

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
import { defineNuxtConfig } from "nuxt/config";

export default defineNuxtConfig({
  // Use `lightningcss` to support syntax lowering for modern CSS features
  vite: {
    build: {
      cssMinify: "lightningcss",
    },
    css: {
      lightningcss: {
        targets: {
          chrome: 120,
        },
      },
    },
  },

  // Use the `nuxt-vite-legacy` module to inject polyfills for relevant user agents
  legacy: {
    targets: ["chrome >= 120"],
  },
  modules: ["nuxt-vite-legacy"],
});
```
