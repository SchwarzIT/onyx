# Installation

Learn how to quickly set up our Vue component library and connect with our Figma assets.

## Vue setup

::info-card{color="neutral" headline="Editors note"}
Visual idea: Decision tree to select which type of application / installation should be done (because the installation steps differ here):

- Components only (plain Vue library)
- Nuxt module
- Documentation template
- Vue Blueprint (for Schwarz internal users)

::

Before you begin, ensure you have a basic [Vue](https://vuejs.org/guide/quick-start.html) or [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/docs/4.x/getting-started/installation) project set up.

If you're starting from scratch, follow their official documentation to initialize your app, then return here to complete the integration.

### Vue only

This is the basic setup for installing our design system in any Vue application.

::info-card{color="info" headline="Using Nuxt?"}
Skip ahead to the [Nuxt guide](#nuxt-users) for a simplified installation with our Nuxt module.
::

1. Install the library via your favorite package manager:

:npm-install-code-tabs{packages="sit-onyx"}

2. To get started, import the styles and initialize the Vue plugin. This enables global configuration, Vue Router support, and additional core features:

```vue [main.ts]
import { createApp } from "vue";
import { createOnyx } from "sit-onyx";

import "sit-onyx/style.css";

// by default, no styles will have side affects on your global application styles like <body> etc.
// when building a whole application with our design system, we recommend also importing the following global styles
// which will apply the correct application background color, font styles etc.:
// import "sit-onyx/global.css";

const onyx = createOnyx({
  // if you are using Vue Router, make sure to pass it here be enable the router integration
  // router: createRouter(),
});

const app = createApp(App);
app.use(onyx);
```

### Nuxt users

1. Simply install our Nuxt module to automate the entire configuration process:

:npm-install-code-tabs{packages="@sit-onyx/nuxt"}

2. Register the module in your Nuxt application:

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  modules: ["@sit-onyx/nuxt"],
  onyx: {
    // optional module options here...
  },
});
```

For more details, see the [Nuxt module documentation](/resources/npm-packages/nuxt).

## Figma setup

::info-card{color="info" headline="Restricted access"}
Our Figma library is currently available exclusively to Schwarz Group employees and their official partners.
::

1. Before proceeding, ensure you have a Figma design file ready. If you need help creating one, refer to the [Figma documentation](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360038511153-Create-a-new-file).
2. To use our components and styles, [add our library](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500008731201-Add-or-remove-a-library-from-a-design-file) to your file following the standard Figma process.

For more details, see the [Figma library documentation](/introduction/getting-started/figma-library).
