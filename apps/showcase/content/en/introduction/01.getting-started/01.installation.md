## Installation

### Prerequisites

We assume that you already have a Vue application set up.
If thats not the case we recommend you first hop over to the [Vue Quickstart Docs](https://vuejs.org/guide/quick-start.html#creating-a-vue-application). Follow the steps there and then continue with the onyx setup here

### Pure ESM

**onyx** only exports EcmaScript modules, as it is a **[Pure ESM package](https://gist.github.com/sindresorhus/a39789f98801d908bbc7ff3ecc99d99c)**.
Therefore it cannot be `require()`'d from CommonJS.
We recommend to read [_The dual-package hazard_](https://nodejs.org/en/learn/modules/publishing-a-package#the-dual-package-hazard) on this issue

### Step 1: Install dependencies

Install the npm package with your corresponding package manager:

```sh [pnpm]
pnpm add sit-onyx
```

```sh [npm]
npm install sit-onyx
```

```sh [yarn]
yarn install sit-onyx
```

### Step 2: Imports

After that, import the global CSS file:

```ts [main.ts]
import { createApp } from "vue";
import { createOnyx } from "sit-onyx";

import "sit-onyx/style.css";

// by default, no onyx styles will have side affects on your global application styles like <body> etc.
// when building a whole application with onyx, we recommend also importing the following global styles
// which will apply the correct application background color, font styles etc.:
// import "sit-onyx/global.css";

const onyx = createOnyx({
  // if you are using the Vue Router, make sure to pass it here be enable the router integration for onyx
  // router: createRouter(),
});
const app = createApp(App);

app.use(onyx);
```

### Step 3: Install fonts

Finally, install the recommended onyx font families by following our [typography docs](/development/typography#installation).

### Step 4: Use components

Components are now ready to be used, e.g.:

```vue
<script lang="ts" setup>
import { OnyxButton } from "sit-onyx";
</script>

<template>
  <OnyxButton label="Click me" />
</template>
```

You can check all onyx components and their documentation in our [Storybook](https://storybook.onyx.schwarz).
