# Figma library

Explores how our design system bridges the gap between design and implementation through an automated, token-driven pipeline that ensures a Single Source of Truth.

## Description

Our design system is far more than a collection of UI components; it is the shared language between UX design and software engineering. We are committed to a Single Source of Truth, ensuring that every design decision made in Figma translates directly into code without information loss or manual overhead.

## Workflow

By deeply integrating our Figma libraries with automated figma-utils, we have replaced traditional "hand-offs" with a synchronized pipeline:

- Automation: Design tokens and variables are extracted directly from Figma and transformed into production-ready code assets.
- Integrity: Designers work within a secure network using validated components, eliminating UI inconsistencies at the root.
- Efficiency: Developers can pull these updates into their applications at the push of a button, drastically reducing "Design-to-Code" lead times.

## Value

This synergy allows us to scale a consistent, accessible (WCAG-compliant), and high-performance brand experience across our entire digital ecosystem. We provide the technological foundation for rapid product development without compromising on design quality.
