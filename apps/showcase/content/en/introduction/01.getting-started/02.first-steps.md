# First steps

Find essential principles and setup steps below. This guide serves as a recurring checklist for both new and experienced users starting a new application.

::info-card{color="neutral" headline="Editors note"}
This page is basically a summary / checklist about advanced onyx topics (layouts, grid, theming etc.) where one simple action is required from the user immediately for a new project. But the full principle is documented on a dedicated sub page (Read more link). Is there a nice way to visualize this?
::

## Layout

Our layout components manage the application's structural complexity, including scroll behavior and navigation positioning. We highly recommend adopting these layouts to avoid manual implementation and maintain system standards.

### App layout

Positioned at the root of your application, the App Layout serves as the shell for global navigation and main content. It also acts as a functional provider for system-level components like [toasts](/resources/components/feedback) and [notifications](/resources/components/notifications).

Example implementation for `App.vue` for plain Vue and `app/app.vue` for Nuxt that includes a basic navigation bar and renders the current page :

#### Vue

```vue [App.vue]
<script lang="ts" setup>
import { OnyxAppLayout, OnyxNavBar, OnyxNavItem } from "sit-onyx";
import { RouterView } from "vue-router";
</script>

<template>
  <OnyxAppLayout>
    <template #navBar>
      <OnyxNavBar app-name="Example app">
        <OnyxNavItem label="Page 1" link="/page-1" />
        <OnyxNavItem label="Page 2" link="/page-2" />
      </OnyxNavBar>
    </template>

    <RouterView />
  </OnyxAppLayout>
</template>
```

#### Nuxt

```vue [app/app.vue]
<template>
  <OnyxAppLayout>
    <template #navBar>
      <OnyxNavBar app-name="Example app">
        <OnyxNavItem label="Page 1" link="/page-1" />
        <OnyxNavItem label="Page 2" link="/page-2" />
      </OnyxNavBar>
    </template>

    <NuxtRouteAnnouncer />

    <NuxtLayout>
      <NuxtPage />
    </NuxtLayout>
  </OnyxAppLayout>
</template>
```

For further information, available slots, customization etc., please visit the [app layout documentation](/resources/templates/app-layout).

### Page layout

Implement the Page Layout on every page to ensure standardized spacing and scroll handling. It provides dedicated slots for easily integrating sidebars, footers, and main content.

```vue [views/HomeView.vue]
<script lang="ts" setup>
import { OnyxHeadline, OnyxPageLayout } from "sit-onyx";
</script>

<template>
  <OnyxPageLayout>
    <OnyxHeadline is="h1">Hello World</OnyxHeadline>
  </OnyxPageLayout>
</template>
```

For recurring elements like sidebars or footers, wrap the PageLayout in a reusable component or [Nuxt layout](https://nuxt.com/docs/4.x/directory-structure/app/layouts). This allows you to apply your custom layout globally to individual pages.

Refer to the [page layout documentation](/resources/templates/page-layout) for API details and customization options.

## Grid

Another key step is configuring your application's layout grid. While we won't cover the technical details here, you can find everything you need to know in our [grid documentation](/introduction/foundation/breakpoints-and-grid).

We recommend defining your content's maximum width and alignment early on.

On very large screens, stretching content across the entire width often degrades the user experience. Our standard recommendation is to cap the content at 1920px (the `lg` breakpoint) and use center alignment, as shown in the example below.

```vue [App.vue]
<script lang="ts" setup>
import { OnyxAppLayout } from "sit-onyx";
</script>

<template>
  <!-- you can also use the "onyx-grid-max-md" class or none to not limit the width at all -->
  <OnyxAppLayout class="onyx-grid-max-lg onyx-grid-center">
    <!-- your app content here... -->
  </OnyxAppLayout>
</template>
```

## Typography

Our design system does not bundle any font families by default, giving you full flexibility in your choice of typography. Unless you have specific requirements, we recommend using 'Source Sans 3' as the primary font and 'Source Code Pro' for monospace content.

For further information, please visit our [typography documentation](/introduction/foundation/typography).

::info-card{headline="Build-in themes"}
When using one of our [build-in themes](/introduction/foundation/colors) you don't need to setup the fonts manually since they will be included in the corresponding theme.
::

1. Install the recommended font packages:

:npm-install-code-tabs{packages="@fontsource-variable/source-sans-3 @fontsource-variable/source-code-pro"}

2. Import the fonts into your entry point (e.g., `main.ts`):

### Vue

```ts [main.ts]
import "@fontsource-variable/source-code-pro";
import "@fontsource-variable/source-sans-3";
```

### Nuxt

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  css: ["@fontsource-variable/source-code-pro", "@fontsource-variable/source-sans-3"],
});
```

## Theming

The design system includes a default theme with a pre-configured color palette. For custom branding, you can either select one of our pre-defined themes]\(/introduction/foundation/colors) or create your own.

::info-card{color="warning" headline="Custom themes"}
A dedicated generator is planned for the future. For now, please refer to our [color documentation](/introduction/foundation/colors) to manually override the theme variables.
::

## Custom styles

::info-card{color="neutral" headline="Editors note"}
In my opinion, that does not belong here. Maybe we can make a "How-Tos" or "Tutorials" section where we explain such things? Can move it to "Support?"
::

Most use cases are covered by built-in component properties. For unique styling requirements, you can easily override our CSS. Use the browser's developer tools to inspect the component's structure and define your custom overrides accordingly.

```vue
<script lang="ts" setup>
import { OnyxInput } from "sit-onyx";
</script>

<template>
  <OnyxInput label="Example label" />
</template>

<style scoped>
:deep(.onyx-form-element__label) {
  color: red;
}
</style>
```

::info-card{color="info" headline="Scoped styles & CSS overrides"}
The `:deep()` selector is necessary when using [scoped styles](https://vuejs.org/api/sfc-css-features#scoped-css) to target child components. While removing `scoped` allows you to omit `:deep()`, be aware that your CSS will become global and may cause unintended side effects across your application. For a deep dive, see Vue’s documentation on [deep selectors](https://vuejs.org/api/sfc-css-features#deep-selector).
::

## Figma setup

::info-card{color="neutral" headline="Editors note"}
Migrate content from the existing [Figma Onboarding](https://www.figma.com/design/t41Pc5yPbcjI6Cz3yIVawI/Onyx-Onboarding?node-id=0-1&p=f&t=feSFyRdXMPMiiq3O-0) file.
::

1. **Enable** the "Thumbnail Library - UX Schwarz IT".
2. **Apply** the project thumbnail to your file.
3. **Structure** your pages using flows and the "Screenflow Cover".
4. **Set** the "Appearance" to your required Onyx theme and density.
5. **Insert** a Full HD frame (1920 x 1080px).
6. **Apply** `onyx/color/base/background/tinted` as the fill color.
7. **Enable** the layout grid.
