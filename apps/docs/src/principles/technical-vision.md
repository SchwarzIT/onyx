# Technical vision & guidelines

Our technical vision describes the goals that we as the development team of **onyx** want to achieve as well as the boundaries we want to respect when developing **onyx**.

**Legend:**

|     | Name   | Description                                               |

| ðŸ“œ  | Rule   | Must be followed. Contributions may be rejected otherwise |
| ðŸ”®  | Vision | Our long-term goal for **onyx**                           |

## Global Architecture

1. ðŸ“œ **onyx** does not have direct dependencies, only a limited amount of peer- and dev-dependencies.
   - peer-dependencies: we allow a wide range of versions (e.g. `>= 3`)
   - We use third-party dependencies sparingly. The need for each dependency must be well justified and documented in this wiki
2. ðŸ“œ We use browser / native features as much as possible. We accept some drawbacks this decision might bring.
3. ðŸ“œ Frequently used code is extracted into utils / composables
4. ðŸ”® We provide custom eslint rules for principles and best practices where needed

## Release process

1. ðŸ“œ Every PR that affects the usage of one of our npm libraries must include a [changeset](https://github.com/changesets/changesets)
2. ðŸ”® All packages use two release channels:
   - `beta`: automatically released on each merge to the `main` branch
   - `default` / `prod`: released after the [current sprint](https://github.com/orgs/SchwarzIT/projects/5/views/1) has ended. Requires manual approval

## Documentation

1. ðŸ“œ Everything we publish (features, packages, ...) must be documented
2. ðŸ“œ The documentation explains everything the users need to know and do not expect implicit knowledge. E.g. all variants that a component offers are showcased and explained when they are used
3. ðŸ”® We provide an overview page which shows previews of all of our components on one page
4. ðŸ”® We have a well understandable changelog which includes all relevant information on the usage of the changes
5. ðŸ”® Our documentation supports fuzzy/keyword searchÂ for finding components

## Usability

1. ðŸ“œ The DX _(Developer Experience)_ of our users is our top priority
2. ðŸ“œ We only support modern technologies [(ES202x)](https://tc39.es/ecma262/)
3. ðŸ“œ **onyx** components work in all of the three big browsers: Chromium, Firefox and Safari
4. ðŸ“œ We offer excellent typing support
5. ðŸ”® We only use Web APIs that have a ["Can I Use"](https://caniuse.com/) score of > X%

## Component Interface

1. ðŸ“œ One use case is covered by only one (public) component
   - e.g. there is only one table component instead of a "basic" and "advanced" table
1. ðŸ“œ Component variants that differ in regards to their [aria pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns) are separate components
1. ðŸ“œ Whether we prefer a property vs. slot based API for a component feature will be decided on a case-by-case-basis
1. ðŸ“œ When Prop/Attr names of the (wrapped) native element are being used for component properties,
   - they must mirror the expected behavior of the native attribute
   - they may limit the natives attribute accepted values (e.g. `type` property of the input could be limited to only support type `text` and `password`)
1. ðŸ“œ [Fallthrough attributes](https://vuejs.org/guide/components/attrs.html) should be passed to the most sensible native element of the component.
   - fallthrough attributes must not be part of the documented or recommended API
1. ðŸ“œ All boolean properties default to `undefined` (falsy)
1. ðŸ“œ We prevent complex conditions due to big union modelValue types.
   - We either offer specialized components (e.g. separating a number input from a text input)
   - Alternatively, we can make use of [generic components](https://vuejs.org/api/sfc-script-setup.html#generics)
1. ðŸ“œ Components are shipped as native Vue components, not as Web Components
1. ðŸ”® We provide translations for standard texts inside components, e.g. "OK", "Cancel" etc. and allow to override them.
   - Community contributions to our translations are most welcome!
1. ðŸ”® We support common navigation patterns, e.g. keyboard shortcuts
1. ðŸ”® The implemented components reflect the capabilities of Figma
   - Exception: We can't limit what will be passed into a slot
   - Exception: We use number and other property types that can not be declared in Figma
1. ðŸ”® We use a shared domain language between UX and DEV
   - e.g. for component names, variable names, ...
1. ðŸ”® All components can be used standalone in a project without affecting styles of the whole application (so they can be used together with other component libraries). Therefore, we provide two CSS files:
   - Component styles: Required. Defines the styles of the components, no side effects on globals
   - Global styles: Optional. Applies global styles to the whole application (e.g. color / background color on `body`, `<a>` etc.) <br>
     Alternatively, a layout component (e.g. OnyxSpace) might be provided for this.

### Naming conventions

1. ðŸ“œ All (public) components are prefixed with `Onyx`, e.g. `OnyxButton`
2. ðŸ“œ We use [v-model](https://vuejs.org/guide/components/v-model.html) for two-way-data-binding wherever possible
3. ðŸ“œ Component variants are named after what they are, not where they are used (e.g. a link variant "fullWidth" instead of "sideBar")
4. ðŸ“œ Event names won't get an `onyx` prefix
5. ðŸ“œ Boolean properties are prefixed with `is-` or `has-`. Exceptions are made to align with default html properties, e.g. `required`
6. ðŸ“œ All CSS class names are prefixed with `onyx-`
7. ðŸ“œ All CSS variables are prefixed with `--onyx-`

## Component Implementation

1. ðŸ“œ A component renders only visible content (e.g. `v-if` instead of `display: none;`)
2. ðŸ“œ We don't clone DOM nodes. Instead, we can place slots in different places depending on the breakpoint
3. ðŸ“œ We only use as much JavaScript as necessary (e.g. prefer CSS over JavaScript)
4. ðŸ“œ Property types are declared and exported as standalone type and referenced in the `defineProps`
   - the property type can still be declared (and exported) inside the component file to which it belongs
5. ðŸ“œ We always use the notation `props.foo` instead of accessing `foo` directly in the `<template>` section
6. ðŸ“œ We structure the component code in the following manner:
   1. types / props / emits
   2. composables
   3. refs
   4. computed / functions
   5. watchers

### A11y (Accessibility)

1. ðŸ“œ We use [semantic HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element)
2. ðŸ“œ We keep the DOM tree as flat as possible
3. ðŸ“œ We follow [A11y best practices](https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-principles/) (level AA)
4. ðŸ“œ We define aria relevant attributes as required
   - e.g. an image component would have a required `alt` property
   - We offer an alternative `inaccessible` or `no-a11y` property, e.g. for declaring decorative images

### Typescript

1. ðŸ“œ We use types instead of interfaces and enums
2. ðŸ“œ We use strict undefined/null checks when implementing the **onyx** ecosystem
3. ðŸ“œ We prefer maps over enums

### CSS

1. ðŸ“œ Instead of using `scoped`/`module` for `<style>`, we rely on meaningful class structures
   - we use [BEM](https://getbem.com/naming/) to provide semantic and structured class names
   - all styles related to a component are bundled inside one component class,
     e.g. the component `OnyxInput` has one class `onyx-input` which groups all styles of that component
2. ðŸ“œ We don't use `!important`
3. ðŸ“œ We define only as little style as needed
   - Instead of copying Figma styles, we evaluate what is needed
4. ðŸ“œ Component styles are limited to the component internals
   - We don't set opinionated margins on the components that define how they are spaced in the page layout.
5. ðŸ“œ We use `flex` for 1 dimensional layouts and `grid` for 2 dimensional layouts
6. ðŸ“œ We avoid writing styles on a parent component that are applied to children that are placed in a slot
   - _Exception: When the alternative would over-complicate the interface, e.g. by requiring extra properties_
7. ðŸ“œ We prefer pseudo-classes over class names we set ourselves
8. ðŸ“œ We prefer styles that don't rely on `:not()`
9. ðŸ“œ We can use `::before` and `::after` for styling
10. ðŸ“œ We use `rem` for **everything**. This includes borders, font-sizes, ...
11. ðŸ“œ We don't infer the device type by the window width

### Testing

1. ðŸ“œ Each (public) component is covered by at least 1 screenshot test (via Playwright)
2. ðŸ“œ All defined component behavior is covered by a playwright test (`.ct.tsx` file)
3. ðŸ“œ Utils and composables are covered by Vitest tests (`.spec.ts` file)
4. ðŸ“œ We structure our tests by using the [arrange-act-assert pattern](https://automationpanda.com/2020/07/07/arrange-act-assert-a-pattern-for-writing-good-tests/)<br>
   ```ts
   // ARRANGE
   // ACT
   // ASSERT
   ```

## Things the future might hold

The following points might be discussed when their use-case gets more concrete.

- Offer package with test-utils
- Measure the performance of components which contain a lot of content
- We provide SSR support / compatibility
- We use [progressive enhancement](https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Glossary/Progressive_Enhancement) where possible
