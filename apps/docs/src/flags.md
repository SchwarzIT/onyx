# Flags

onyx includes a set of well-crafted SVG flags that are free to use.

If you want to download the flags as SVG, please head over to our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/SchwarzIT/onyx/tree/main/packages/flags/src/assets).

A full changelog can be found [here](/development/packages/changelogs/flags).

## Installation

To get started, install the npm package with your corresponding package manager:

::: code-group

```sh [pnpm]
pnpm add -D @sit-onyx/flags@beta
```

```sh [npm]
npm install -D @sit-onyx/flags@beta
```

```sh [yarn]
yarn install -D @sit-onyx/flags@beta
```

:::

Afterwards, you can import and use flags as needed. Please see the [OnyxIcon](https://storybook.onyx.schwarz/?path=/docs/basic-icon--docs) for the technical documentation. Technically, flags are used the same way as icons in onyx. This means that also flags can be passed for all components that support icons.

## Usage

There are two different ways of using / importing flags from this package:

### Option 1: JavaScript import <Badge text="recommended" />

> **Requires @sit-onyx/flags version >= 1.0.0-beta.5**

For the best developer experience, it is recommended to use JavaScript imports. This approach also supports IDE intellisense, so you can e.g. just start typing "flag" in your editor and all available flags will be suggested to you.

```ts
import { flagDE } from "@sit-onyx/flags";

// or to import all flags (note: no tree-shaking will be supported then):
// import * as ALL_FLAGS from "@sit-onyx/flags";
```

### Option 2: Import from SVG file

Alternatively, you can import the icon from the raw SVG file:

```ts
// Note that "?raw" is needed to import the SVG content instead of a path to the file itself.
// ?raw will be resolved by the bundler (e.g. Vite).
// if you want to import the path to the flag instead of the content, you can omit the "?raw" part
import flagDE from "@sit-onyx/flags/DE.svg?raw";
```

## Country names

You can get the country name of a flag in several languages using JavaScript's [Intl.DisplayNames](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/DisplayNames) API.

Here is an example on how to use it (together with [vue-i18n](https://vue-i18n.intlify.dev/)):

::: details Expand code snippet

```ts
import { useI18n } from "vue-i18n";

const { locale } = useI18n();

const countryNames = computed(() => new Intl.DisplayNames(locale.value, { type: "region" }));
const germany = computed(() => countryNames.value.of("DE"));
// Output (depending on the locale):
// "Germany" if locale is EN
// "Deutschland" if locale is DE
// ...
```

:::

Alternatively, there is also metadata available for each flag exported from the `@sit-onyx/flags` package:

::: details Expand code snippet

```ts
import { FLAG_METADATA } from "@sit-onyx/flags/utils";

console.log(FLAG_METADATA.DE);
// Output: { internationalName: "Germany", continent: "Europe" }
```

## Available flags

You can hover over a flag to see its name. Click on it or press enter when selecting it via keyboard to copy the import statement for the selected flag.

<script lang="ts" setup>
import OnyxFlagLibrary from ".vitepress/components/OnyxFlagLibrary.vue"
</script>

<OnyxFlagLibrary />
