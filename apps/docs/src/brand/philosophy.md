# Philosophy

We practice a well-structured and principle-based way of working

## Agility

We adapt quickly to changes and divide our tasks into smaller parts in order to work on them in short sprints. This allows us to maintain an overview and adapt our plans accordingly - depending on the current situation.

## The community

We value our community and love to get in touch with you all. That's why we use [GitHub](https://github.com/SchwarzIT/onyx) as a platform that allows us to exchange ideas with you and gather feedback. Your input shapes our work and improves the product.

## Flexibility

We design and create our components according to the latest web standards. This means they can be used in all kinds of projects and are super versatile.

## Quality

From planning to the final stages of implementation, we put our knowledge and skills into our design system at the highest level. We want it to work smoothly for all our end users alike.

## Collaboration

The skills and expertise of everyone are involved in our decisions by working closely together. We take everyone's skills and input into account and rely on each other.
