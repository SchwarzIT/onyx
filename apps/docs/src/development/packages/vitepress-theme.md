| s               | `640px`  |
| m               | `768px`  |

:::

```scss
@use "@sit-onyx/vitepress-theme/mixins.scss";

.some-class {
  @include mixins.breakpoint(max, m) {
    // your styles for m breakpoint and smaller
  }

  @include mixins.breakpoint(min, m) {
    // your styles for m breakpoint and larger
  }

  // the breakpoint is inclusive so if you e.g. want to use
  // min and max for the same breakpoint you should
  // define an offset for either min or max
  @include mixins.breakpoint(max, xl) {
    // your styles for smaller and equal xl breakpoint
  }

  @include mixins.breakpoint(min, xl, 1) {
    // your styles for greater than xl breakpoint (exclusive)
  }
}
```
