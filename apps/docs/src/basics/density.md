# Density

In designing and developing user interfaces, the density of components plays a pivotal role in shaping the user experience. Introducing three levels of density - **compact**, **default** and **cozy** - onyx provides a flexible toolkit to build applications for multiple user preferences and device capabilities. The three densities are always based around the specific values of **32px**, **40px**, and **48px**.

## Compact

This is ideal for users, who prefer a more condensed layout. Compact density maximizes the amount of information displayed on the screen. It's particularly beneficial for offering an efficient use of limited space.

## Default

Striking a balance between information density and visual comfort, default component density is the standard that caters to a broad user base and is recommended to most of the applications. It ensures a comfortable and intuitive experience for users across various devices and screen sizes.

## Cozy

Designed for users who appreciate a more spacious and visually relaxed interface, cozy density introduces plenty of whitespace between and inside elements. This level of density enhances readability and provides visually appealing experience, suitable for users who prioritize on a more leisure interaction.

## Properties

The density can be easily switched via the `density` property of supported components. Please take a look at the [components](/development/) for further information.
