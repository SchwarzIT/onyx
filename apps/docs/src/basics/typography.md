# Typography

The onyx font system includes two different font families that can be used throughout your application, pending on the usecase. It contains several headline styles as well as paragraph styles and mono space styles.

::: info
The font families that can be used with onyx are:

- [Source Sans 3](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Sans+3)
- [Source Code Pro](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Code+Pro?query=source)

Lidl and Kaufland font families are coming soon.

:::

## Brand typography

The default font family is defined to be the Source Sans and Source Code Pro (monospace). If you are creating a new onyx project, this will always be included out-of-the-box. In the initial phase, Source Sans applies to all color themes that are provided by onyx.

If you want to use custom font families, please take a look at the [technical documentation](/development/typography).

## Usage

It is important to keep the usage of font styles consistent throughout the whole application. Only by following this principle, a clean and hierarchical UI structure can be guaranteed. You should focus on the correct usage for headlines in particular! If you have questions about it, please contact your assigned UX-Designer.

## Line length

To create a flowing readability, the line length is key. There are no strict rules on the usage, due to the dependency on [screen size, breakpoint and column grid](/basics/breakpoints-grid). Nevertheless onyx provides some guidelines and recommendations for your implementation.

![image](/assets/line_length.webp)

Generally speaking: the wider the line the harder to read and to follow. The optimal range for readability is usually between 60 and 80 characters. If the text is way longer than this guideline, just use a second text column instead.

## Writing style

If you want to use text in your application, please take the following principles into account.

::: details Focus

Formulate your text purposefully and concisely. Do not use unnecessary verbiage. Nevertheless, form short, complete and grammatically correct sentences.

:::

::: details Descriptive

Describe prompts clearly and use the imperative (especially with buttons). Buttons are always titled with verbs and should at best consist of only one word. More than one word is possible in exceptional cases.

:::

::: details Hierarchy

Hierarchy is key to a well working user experience. Always be aware on how to use section titles and element headlines.
Also use [color and contrast](/basics/colors) for creating hierarchy in a subtle way.

:::

::: details Context

Texts must always have a connection to the things that are going on in the screen, in terms of content.
Never text about content, the user cannot relate to.

:::

::: details Consistency

Texts should never be built in uppercase. Always use the provided line height for spacing. Do not try to squeeze characters or text blocks. Less is more - Minimalism is key.

:::

## Links

Links are the tool of choice to refer to another page. Please use the `link` font style. By default, links have an underline and are primary-colored. Under consideration of the text styling principles, the text color can be changed in exceptional usecases. Please doublecheck with your assigned UX-Designer.

## Truncation

For more details about truncation and how to use it, please visit the [truncation basics](/basics/truncation).
