Custom [VitePress](https://vitepress.dev) theme that uses the Onyx design system.

## Features

The theme includes the following features:

- light and dark theme that matches the Onyx design
- colored name and gradient logo background on the [home page](/)
- Font families matching the [Onyx typography system](/typography)
